        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            This website provides a tool for calculating Intraocular Lens (IOL)
            power ("Tool") designed to assist eye care professionals in
            selecting the appropriate IOL for patients undergoing cataract
            surgery. The Tool is intended as an adjunctive resource to
            complement, not replace, the comprehensive ophthalmic examination
            and diagnostic testing traditionally employed in clinical practice.
            The results obtained by the calculator are not intended to serve as
            medical or surgical instruction.
        </p>

        <h4>Accuracy and Limitations</h4>
        <p>
            The results generated by the Tool are based on mathematical models
            and should be used in conjunction with clinical judgement and
            professional standards of care. While we strive for accuracy, the
            variability in patient anatomies, surgical techniques, and
            measurement devices means that the Tool's predictions are not
            guaranteed. The responsibility for the final IOL selection rests
            with the treating physician, and users should verify calculations
            through alternative means where possible.
        </p>

        <h4>Liability</h4>
        <p>
            By using this Tool, users agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
            website owners, authors, affiliates, and any other parties involved
            in the creation and maintenance of the Tool from any claims,
            damages, or losses arising from its use. This includes direct,
            indirect, incidental, and consequential damages, regardless of
            whether such damages were foreseeable.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Privacy and Security</h4>
        <p>
            We respect the privacy of our users and the confidentiality of the
            data entered into the Tool. All data entered is processed on a
            session basis and not saved beyond the user's current interaction
            with the Tool, unless explicitly consented to by the user for
            purposes of improving the Tool's accuracy and functionality.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Privacy and Storage</h4>
        <p>
            Data Ownership and Responsibility: The users of this website retain
            full ownership and responsibility for the data they input into the
            Tool. As an intermediary, this website facilitates storage of
            calculation data to enable users to access their past calculations
            for convenience and to assist in the continuity of patient care.
            However, the ultimate responsibility for the data's accuracy,
            privacy, and security rests with the user.
